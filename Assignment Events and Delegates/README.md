### Exercise 1: Lambda and delegates
Create a list of integers and call where method on it and pass delegate to it in the following ways:
- 1.	Find odd - Lambda Expression – without curly brackets
- 2.	Find Even - Lambda Expression – with curly brackets
- 3.	Find Prime – Anonymous Method
- 4.	Find Prime Another – Lambda Expression
- 5.	Find Elements Greater Than Five – Method Group Conversion Syntax
- 6.	Find Less than Five – Delegate Object in Where – Method Group Conversion Syntax in Constructor of Object
- 7.	Find 3k – Delegate Object in Where –Lambda Expression in Constructor of Object
- 8.	Find 3k + 1 - Delegate Object in Where –Anonymous Method in Constructor of Object
- 9.	Find 3k + 2 - Delegate Object in Where –Lambda Expression Assignment
- 10.	Find anything - Delegate Object in Where – Anonymous Method Assignment 
- 11.	Find anything - Delegate Object in Where – Method Group Conversion Assignment

### Exercise 2: Events
```
Create a Product-Inventory software (No need of user Input or any other validations)
Product: (Override Equals or implement IEquatable<T>)
1.	Id
2.	Price
3.	IsDefective
Inventory:
1.	 Dictionary containing all the products and their respective quantities in the inventory
2.	Total value of the inventory
Methods
1.	Add Product
2.	Remove Product
3.	Update Product Quantity

On change of Product’s Price, Inventory total value should get updated
If a Product becomes defective, remove it from the inventory.
(Handle them through EventHandler)
```
 
### Exercise 3:  Collections and Events
```
Create an Observable Collection. Listen to its Collection Changed Event and display 
message on UI for each operation.
1.	Addition: “Element ‘x’ is added in collection”
2.	Removal: “Element ‘x’ is removed from collection”
Use enum NotifyCollectionChangedAction to differentiate the action
```
